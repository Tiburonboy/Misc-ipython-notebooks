| filename | discription |
|:----------|:-------------|
| Launch acceleration_date.ipynb | Calculates launch acceleration for a rail launch missile at various altitudes and Mach numbers. | 
| Link Analysis.ipynb | Link Analysis for RF link. |
| Junction Temp Calculations.ipynb | The python code in this notebook will calculate the junction temperature of a semiconductor device. Pulsed power and reliability considerations will also be addressed. |
| 25MHz IF Bandwidth Study.ipynb | Look at occupted bandwidth within the IF channel |
| TQP3M9037 thermal | Simplified thermal analysis of the amplifiers used in the RF front end section of the phased phased array. |
| SOQPSK-TG | Some python code to explore SOQPSK as defined in chapter 2 of IRIG 106-17, page 16, paragraph 2.3.3.2. This notebook walks through the describtion of SOQPSK as defined in IRIG 106-17 and implements differential coding, pre-coder and impulse shaping filter. |
| Category 7 Jet aircraft vibration exposure | Compare vibration levels of DO-160, MIL-STD-810G and other typical aircraft enviroments |
| parameters | Python code to interpolate device parameters at 70C and extrapolate parameters to -55C. |
